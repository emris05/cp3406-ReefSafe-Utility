# Reef Safe

A utility app for **CP3406 Assessment 1**. Tells you, at a glance, whether the reef is worth the drive out of Townsville today — visibility, sea temperature, waves, wind, tide, UV, and a single 0–100 snorkel score with a verdict.

Built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Material Design 3**.
